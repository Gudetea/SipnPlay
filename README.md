<h1>Codedex Hackathon Summer 2024 // Track 1</h1>

This was our first hackathon!! We learned so much during the process, but also it was so difficult to learn while given a time constraint ;;
I spent more time on the design than I liked to, which left little to no time to actually attempt to code it ): 
But!! We did get three.js to work and it was very exciting to see things go well.. until it didnt .. 
The actual github page is a mess, but I promise it doesn't look that bad, we just couldn't deploy vite properly in time 

We will continue this project despite the hackathon being over, so if you like the prototype, look forward to the actual website (:
